Added README

## This is based off of the tutorial done by Stewart Lynch.

### I followed this and got it working great, but I wanted to add a little more to it.

## What I added
Firebase Authentication
Firebase Login
Player Model for Firebase
Leaderboard

## What I learned
Firebase comes with simple email/password authentication to add to the db, but I figured out how to add other properties as well to create a Player model to save\
Querying Firebase and sorting for the Leaderboard\
Updating Firebase and the View

## What I'd like to add
Easy Mode, maybe only 4 letters\
Better Leaderboard View\
Sign-out View\
